Question1 - What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?

Ans - Autoboxing: Automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.
For example – conversion of int to Integer, long to Long, double to Double etc.

Unboxing: It is just the reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding
primitive type is known as unboxing. For example – conversion of Integer to int, Long to long, Double to double etc.

Question2 - Difference between Git and Svn?

      Git branches are easier to work with than SVN branches.
      
Question3 - Difference between ArrayList & LinkedList?
Ans - Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses doubly linked list so no bit shifting is required in memory.

ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.

ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
